      <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody Dunne</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>
      
      
      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      
      <p><em>Summary of user needs and motivating questions.</em></p>
      
      <p><em>Expectation: There is a clear focus, and a developed explanation of the problem, and a reasonable response is proposed.</em></p>
      <p> Increased automobile usage in Boston and the world in general has made the availability of parking spaces a problem today. Furthermore, allocation of parking spaces must take into consideration the rights of an area's residents while maximizing parking availability for the non-residential public, which is important businesses, tourism, and commuting professionals among others. Making these decisions without adequate can be impossible, but parking data is hard to come by, as it cannot be collected by any kind of automatic electronic data and is not highly regulated on a day to day basis. Parking studies require time and money or volunteers. Thus, our project conducted a parking study in the Chester Square neighborhood and created interactive visualizations that can guide these decision making processes, discover inefficiencies in the existing system, propose solutions based on data, and communicate these decisions, problems, and solutions to stakeholders. </p>
      
      <h1>Visualization</h1>
      
      <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>

      <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
      
      <p><em>final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>
      <p>Data was collected by a few teams on Tuesday, October 22, 2019 in three five hour shifts from 6 am to 8 pm in teams of 2. A route was prepared, and pairs of volunteers walked the route starting on the hour. We recorded the first three letters of each license plate and noted abnormalities such as construction or incidents of double or otherwise illegal parking behavior. We also recorded whether a vehicle has an out-of-state license plate or a resident parking sticker. The route and a sample data sheet are presented below (TODO add image). Routes were divided up into a realistic number of spaces for the area between landmarks (lampposts, driveways, hydrants, etc). Each round of records took 30 to 50 minutes. After collection, the data was entered by another team in a spreadsheet and shared. No additional data sources were used. </p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p>The primary consumer of our visualization would most likely be partner organization members and anyone who is actively working to identify problems and create solutions in the neighborhood. We intend our visualization to be used for summarizing who is using parking, identifying trends in parking usage, and possibly discover policy or infrastructural changes that can be made  in the neighborhood that can result in improvements based on data.</p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
      
      <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
      Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
      Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
      
      <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
